# Contact Form Setup with Resend

This portfolio includes a fully functional contact form that uses Resend to send emails when visitors submit the form.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Resend Account
1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up for a free account
2. Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your API Key
1. Go to the [API Keys section](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Portfolio Contact Form")
4. Select "Sending access"
5. Copy the generated API key

### 3. Set Up Your Domain (Recommended)
For production use, you should add and verify your own domain:
1. Go to the [Domains section](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Follow the DNS verification steps
5. Once verified, you can send emails from `contact@yourdomain.com`

**Note:** Without a custom domain, you can only send emails from `onboarding@resend.dev`, but this is fine for testing.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
1. Open `.env.local` in your project
2. Add your configuration:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=contact@yourdomain.com  # Or onboarding@resend.dev for testing
TO_EMAIL=amiirdrbii@gmail.com      # Your email where messages will be sent
```

### 5. Deploy to Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your project to Vercel
3. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add the same environment variables from your `.env.local`

## Testing Locally
1. Make sure your environment variables are set in `.env.local`
2. Run `npm run dev`
